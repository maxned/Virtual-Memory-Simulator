This is almost a virtual memory simulator.

Only relevant information for the virtual memory is that there can only be 4 pages in RAM at at time.
Each page is 1KB in size and the virtual address space is 4GB which results in a 32 bit size address.
The program uses a clock replacement algorithm for the pages in the page table. 

The output are the pages' address of the first byte that are currently present in the page table in RAM.

Provide either vmtest-1000-6.txt, vmtest-1000-7.txt, or vmtest-1000-8.txt in the argument when running the program. Then compare with the results in vm-out-1000-6.txt, vm-out-1000-7.txt, or vm-out-1000-8.txt
The output file of the program will always be vm-out.txt

If running the program in Xcode, all you need to do is copy the vmtest-1000-*.txt into the compiled product folder in Finder. The argument for running the program is already set in the scheme for vmtest-1000-6.txt, but you need to choose the correct input file.
